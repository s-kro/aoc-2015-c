Advent of Code 2015 in C

In the town, where I was Borne,
there lived a man, who wrote in C
And he told us of his life
in the land of subroutines.

As we booted the old Sun
Emacs made the constants green,
And we lived beneath the main()
in our yellow subroutine.

We all live in a yellow subroutine
Yellow subroutine, yellow subroutine
We all live in a yellow subroutine
Yellow subroutine, yellow subroutine

As we live a life of ease (a life of ease)
Every one of us (every one of us)
Has all the memory we need (then memory we need)
variables of blue (variables of blue)
And constants of green (constants of green)
In our yellow (in our yellow)
Subroutine (subroutine, aha)
